| ---- | ---- |
| 0. What's my name | [0-print_name.c](./0-print_name.c) |
| 1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done | [1-array_iterator.c](./1-array_iterator.c) |
| 2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities | [2-int_index.c](./2-int_index.c) |
| 3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at | [3-main.c](./3-main.c), [3-op_functions.c](./3-op_functions.c), [3-get_op_func.c](./3-get_op_func.c), [3-calc.h](./3-calc.h) |
